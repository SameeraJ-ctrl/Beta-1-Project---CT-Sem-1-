PROJECT DESCRIPTION

It was made as my Beta 1 project for a coding course "Fundamentals of Computational Thinking" in Semester 1 
This project simulates a logistics planning system to optimize the transportation of goods using the nearest available logistic hubs. It randomly generates locations for goods and hubs on a 2D grid and then:

* It identifies two random goods locations for pickup

*  Selects a final destination

*  Calculates the nearest hub that minimizes the total distance from both pickup points

* Computes the fuel consumption and cost for the route:

* From each goods location to the hub

* From the hub to the final destination

* Visualizes the entire route using a 2D plot (goods locations, hubs, selected points, and final destination)

Libraries Used: 
1. NumPy
2.  Pandas
3.  Matplotlib

It demonstrates core concepts in:

* Distance-based optimization (Euclidean distance)

* Cost estimation using real-world parameters (fuel cost per km)

* Data visualization and simulation
